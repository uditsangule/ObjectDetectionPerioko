3. Improvements in Object Detection and Tracking:

	A. Adding Parent to child relationship on Classids to get less confusion and more 



4. Future Version / Changes:
    • GPU support can be provided in code , which can reduce inference time by 10x.
    • Model selection automation code that detects the frame size and harware capabilities to select model size of its own.
    •
